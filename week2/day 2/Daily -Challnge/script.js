//Daily Challenge: Not Bad
// 1.Create a variable called sentence. The value of the variable should be a string that contains 
// the words “not” and “bad”. For example, “The movie is not that bad, I like it”.
// 2.Create a variable called wordNot where it’s value is the first appearance of the substring “not” (from the sentence variable).
// 3.Create a variable called wordBad where it’s value is the first appearance of the substring “bad” (from the sentence variable).
// 4.If the word “bad” comes after the word “not”, you should replace the whole “not…bad” substring with “good”, 
// then console.log the result.
// 5.For example, the result here should be : “The movie is good, I like it”
// 6.If the word “bad” does not come after “not” or the words are not in the sentence, console.log the original sentence.

// let string = 'i went to show and it was not so bad.';
// let not = string.indexOf('not');
// let bad = string.indexOf('bad');

// //     console.log('I went to show and it was not so bad');

// if ('bad' < 'not') {
//     console.log('I went to show and it was good');
// }
//     else {
//     console.log(string);
// }


let string = 'i went to show and it was not so bad , it was nice';
let arrsentence = sentence.split( );
let not = arrsentence.indexOf('not');
let bad = arrsentence.indexOf('bad');

//     console.log('I went to show and it was not so bad');

if ('bad' > 'not' && ) {
    console.log('I went to show and it was good');
}
    else {
    console.log(string);
}
