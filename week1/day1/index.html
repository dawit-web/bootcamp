        <h2> About domestic cats </h2> 
        <P>
        They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there 
        is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines. 
        They are often valued by humans for companionship.
        There are more than seventy cat breeds recognized by various cat registries.. </P>

        The lions

        Present in Africa and India, the lion typically inhabits grasslands and savannahs, 
        but is absent in dense forests. It is usually more diurnal than other big cats, 
        but when persecuted adapts to being active at night and at twilight. 
        A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs. Prides vary in size and composition from three to 20 adult lions, depending on habitat and prey availability. 
        Females cooperate when hunting and prey mostly on large ungulates, including antelope, deer, buffalo, zebra and even giraffe
